The intention of this fileset is to provide the user with
a set of runnable files, giving the choice of which to run.

The intention was that each runnable would be a self-sustaining quine,
with a flexible order of progression, but do to time constraints and
lack of manpower, this fails in the case of the 

QuineGen.java is the original work of James Bilbrey.

To run the quine, enter the following commands:
<br>$ make clean
<br>$ make
<br>$ make runX where X is an extension such as c, java

To update from the latest source, run the following in a folder
<br>WITH NO CONTENTS OTHER THAN THIS PROJECT:
<br>$ make update
<br><br>I take no responsibility for any data lost from running that command.
By using it you acknowledge that you have been warned of its affects,
and agree not to hold James Bilbrey accountable for any data
lost due to misuse.
