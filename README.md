QuineGen.java is the original work of James Bilbrey.
To generate one-line strings of the working files, use "make quine".

Credit for the function with signature "char* replace_str(char *str, char *orig, char *rep)" used in C and CPP files goes to itsme86 (http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/replace-a-substring-with-another-string-in-c-170076/). The comments for this function can be viewed at the source.

The C function "void generateContent(char* nextLang)" needs a comment that reads "C is obnoxious".
